## Overview
[Whether Sweater](https://github.com/aedanjames/whether_sweater) Whether Sweater is a Ruby on Rails Backend API based application. It follows restful convention and exposes endpoints for FE consumption. Current endpoints allow for a FE app to retrieve weather, and background images for a city. Register a user, to receive an API key, log in, and make a POST request to plan for road trips. 

## Goals Achieved    
* Expose API endpoints that provide unique functionality via interfacing response data from multiple 3rd party API requests. 
* Follow RESTFUL convention. 
* Provide useful error responses, with the intention of aiding FE developers' efforts to debug.
